* Package System

The first thing we need to do is initialize =emacs='s package
system. That's achieved with the following =elisp= code.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
  (package-initialize)
#+END_SRC

* Basics

This is where I'll setup some basic defaults for =emacs=. Things like
=user-full-name=, =user-mail-address= and similar will be here.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq user-full-name "Felipe Balbi"
        user-mail-address "felipe.balbi@linux.intel.com"
        calendar-latitude 60.17
        calendar-longitude 24.94
        calendar-location-name "Helsinki, FI"
        inhibit-startup-screen t
        make-backup-files t)
  (global-prettify-symbols-mode t)
#+END_SRC

I tend to hit =C-x C-c= by accident all the time. This little trick
helps me a lot

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq config-kill-emacs 'yes-or-no-p)
#+END_SRC

Numbers, numbers, numbers...

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq column-number-mode t
        fill-column 80
        indent-tabs-mode t
        linum-format "%4d")

  (global-linum-mode t)
#+END_SRC

And I like to highlight current line

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when window-system (global-hl-line-mode))
#+END_SRC

* Setup a new home for =custom-file=

Well, I don't want =custom= touching my beautiful =init.el=. Let's give
it a dumping ground.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (unless (file-exists-p "~/.emacs.d/custom.el")
    (with-temp-buffer (write-file "~/.emacs.d/custom.el")))

  (setq custom-file "~/.emacs.d/custom.el")
  (load custom-file)
#+END_SRC

* Bars Galore

Don't you hate all these bars in =emacs=? I do, let's disable them:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (scroll-bar-mode -1)
  (horizontal-scroll-bar-mode -1)
  (menu-bar-mode -1)
  (tool-bar-mode -1)
#+END_SRC

* Install =use-package= if necessary

I really want to be able to just move to a new computer and have all my
configuration available in a way that I don't have to anything manually
anymore and still get *my* =emacs= the way *I* like it.

This is likely gonna cost me some init time, but every time =emacs=
starts out, I'll check if we need to install =use-package= and
conditionally install it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
    (package-refresh-contents)
    (package-install 'use-package))

  (eval-when-compile
    (require 'use-package))
#+END_SRC

* Setup =company-mode=

Auto-completion is always useful, so I'll be using it as much as
possible.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package company
    :ensure t
    :bind ("TAB" . company-indent-or-complete-common)
    :defer 1
    :config (global-company-mode))
#+END_SRC

* Setup =magit=

I tend to use =magit= for most of my =git= needs. Let's set it up.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package magit
    :ensure t
    :defer 1)
#+END_SRC

* Setup =solarized-theme=

I've gotten used to the look and feel of =solarized-dark= and plan to
continue using it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package solarized-theme
    :if window-system
    :ensure t
    :config (load-theme 'solarized-dark t nil))
#+END_SRC

* Setup =geiser=

=guile= is a language that lately I've been trying to get acquainted to
and, as such, I need a cool way of communicating with a =REPL= from
inside =emacs=. =gueiser= seems to be a good choice for that

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package geiser
    :ensure t
    :defer 1)
#+END_SRC

* Setup =paredit=

This is probably the most awkward mode to get used to. Still, it's so
darn helpful that I just have to use it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package paredit
    :ensure t
    :config
    (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook       #'enable-paredit-mode)
    (add-hook 'eval-expression-minibuffer-setup-hook #'enable-paredit-mode)
    (add-hook 'ielm-mode-hook             #'enable-paredit-mode)
    (add-hook 'lisp-mode-hook             #'enable-paredit-mode)
    (add-hook 'lisp-interaction-mode-hook #'enable-paredit-mode)
    (add-hook 'scheme-mode-hook           #'enable-paredit-mode))
#+END_SRC

* Setup =helm=

Oh, dear =helm=; how could I possibly live without you.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package helm
    :ensure t
    :bind (("M-x" . helm-M-x)
           ("TAB" . helm-execute-persistent-action)
           ("C-x r b" . helm-bookmarks)
           ("M-y" . helm-show-kill-ring)
           ("C-x C-y" . helm-find-files))
    :config
    (require 'helm-config)
    (setq helm-split-window-in-side-p t
          helm-move-to-line-cycle-in-source t
          helm-ff-search-library-in-sexp t
          helm-scroll-amount 8
          helm-ff-file-name-history-use-recentf t)
    (helm-mode t))
#+END_SRC

* Setup =helm-ls-git=

A very good extension to =helm=...

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package helm-ls-git
    :ensure t
    :bind ("C-x C-d" . helm-browse-project))
#+END_SRC

* Setup =helm-git-grep=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package helm-git-grep
    :ensure t
    :bind (("C-c g" . helm-git-grep-from-help)
           (:map isearch-mode-map
                    ("C-c g" . helm-git-grep-from-isearch))))
#+END_SRC

* Setup =powerline=

=powerline= turns =emacs='s mode line into something so useful that I
can't live without it anymore.

Note that in order to use =powerline= we need to install a
=powerline=-patched font. I kinda line DejaVu Sans and that's what I'll
use.

For the sake of documentation, here's how I've manually setup
=powerline=-patched fonts.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval no
  $ git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git
  $ cd fonts
  $ ./install.sh
#+END_SRC

Now, let's get going with setting up =powerline=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (set-face-attribute 'default nil
                      :font "DejaVu Sans Mono for Powerline:style=Book"
                      :height 110)

  (use-package powerline
    :ensure t
    :config (powerline-default-theme))
#+END_SRC

* Setup =org= and =org-bullets=

=org= is =emacs='s organizer package. I use it a lot and really enjoy
it. Let's set it up.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package org
    :ensure t
    :bind
    (("C-c l" . org-store-link)
     ("C-c a" . org-agenda)
     ("C-c c" . org-capture)
     ("C-c b" . org-iswitchb))
    :config (require 'ox-odt nil t))

  (use-package org-bullets
    :ensure t
    :config
    (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
              (lambda () (org-bullets-mode t)))
    (setq org-hide-leading-stars t))
#+END_SRC

with that out of the way, let's configure our preferred =org-directory=
location and point =org= to our org files.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-directory "~/workspace/org"
        org-default-notes-file (concat org-directory "/notes.org")
        org-agenda-files (concat org-directory "/agenda.org")
        org-ellipsis "â†´"
        org-src-fontify-natively t
        org-src-tab-acts-natively t)
#+END_SRC

* Setup =magit=

This is simple to configure.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package magit
    :ensure t
    :config (setq magit-diff-use-overlays nil
                  magit-commit-arguments '("--signoff")))
#+END_SRC

* Setup =eshell=

Really not much here, I just need a key chord to start =eshell= at will

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package eshell
    :ensure t
    :bind ("C-c t" . eshell))
#+END_SRC

* Enable some disabled commands

Few commands I want to use but are disabled by default
  
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (put 'narrow-to-region 'disabled nil)
  (put 'upcase-region 'disabled nil)
#+END_SRC
